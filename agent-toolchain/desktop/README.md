# agent-worker desktop sandbox

Self-contained, run-only graphical sandboxes: a screen stack (virtual display +
VNC + noVNC) plus the agent-worker binary, all in one image, viewable in a
browser. Built `FROM agent-toolchain/toolchain-base`, so the base build tools
come along (no extra toolchain is installed).

Two flavors:

| flavor | stack | use when |
|---|---|---|
| `openbox` | **pure X11**: `Xvfb :99 → D-Bus+AT-SPI2 → openbox → x11vnc :5900 → websockify :6080` | jobs must **drive X11 apps** (computer-use / a11y, xdotool/xclip/xsel are X11-only) |
| `labwc`   | **pure Wayland**: `labwc (headless) → wayvnc :5900 → websockify :6080` | native Wayland clients |

> X11-only automation (`xdotool`, `xclip`, `xsel`, and the `xa11y` a11y CLI)
> **cannot** target Wayland clients, and labwc does not provide an X server. If
> you need to drive an X11 app, use the `openbox` flavor.

## Computer-use / accessibility (openbox only)

The `openbox` image bakes in the **`xa11y`** CLI (github.com/xa11y/xa11y) plus
the **AT-SPI2** stack (`at-spi2-core`, `dbus`), so a job can read and drive
native apps through their accessibility trees instead of guessing from pixels:

```sh
xa11y apps                                   # running apps
xa11y tree  --app zenity                      # accessibility tree
xa11y find  'button[name="OK"]' --app zenity -o center
xa11y action press 'button[name="OK"]' --app zenity
xa11y click --at X,Y ; xa11y type "hello" ; xa11y screenshot --out /tmp/s.png
```

The entrypoint brings up Xvfb, then a **D-Bus session bus + AT-SPI2 bus
launcher/registry**, then agent-worker; the screen stack (openbox/x11vnc/noVNC)
follows in the background. Order matters: `at-spi2-registryd` opens the X
display, and jobs inherit the worker's environment, so the a11y bus must be live
before the worker starts. The session bus uses a **fixed** address
(`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/tmp/agent-dbus`, set in the image ENV) so
the address jobs see is known ahead of the worker's boot.

`xa11y` is not on any registry as a binary (upstream ships only Python/JS
wheels + crates), so `scripts/build-xa11y.sh` builds it from source into
`dist/xa11y-linux-amd64`; `build.sh` stages it into the image. Its only
non-glibc runtime dependency is `libxkbcommon0` (installed by the image);
D-Bus/AT-SPI/X11 are loaded at runtime.

The **labwc** flavor has no a11y CLI: a Wayland tree path needs a different
backend (`xa11y-linux` does support Wayland input via `/dev/uinput`, but the
desktop sandbox does not ship it yet).

## Gateway sandbox

Unlike `sandbox-<lang>` images (whose sole `ENTRYPOINT` is `agent-worker`), this
image ships its **own** entrypoint that starts the screen stack *and*
agent-worker. The gateway does not override the entrypoint, so it is a normal
`CreateSandbox` target like any `sandbox/` image (no `kvm` needed). Xvfb and the
a11y bus come up first (readiness still a few seconds); the visible desktop
(openbox/x11vnc/noVNC) starts in the background.

You can also run it as a plain Deployment — exactly like
`k8s/agent-worker-android.yaml`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/agent-worker-desktop.yaml   # edit image tag for the flavor
```

Endpoints (in-pod): `:48080` worker API, `:6080` noVNC (open, ClusterIP only),
`:5900` VNC (internal).

## Layout

```
openbox/Containerfile    pure-X11 image (Xvfb/openbox/x11vnc/noVNC + xa11y/a11y + worker)
openbox/entrypoint.sh    starts Xvfb -> D-Bus/AT-SPI -> agent-worker, then openbox/VNC
labwc/Containerfile      pure-Wayland image (labwc/wayvnc/noVNC + worker)
labwc/entrypoint.sh      starts agent-worker, then the Wayland stack (background)
build.sh                 build+push one flavor (buildctl → skopeo → registry)
```

## Build

```sh
scripts/build-all.sh                          # dist/agent-worker-linux-amd64
scripts/build-xa11y.sh                        # dist/xa11y-linux-amd64 (openbox)
./agent-toolchain/desktop/build.sh openbox    # -> sandbox/sandbox-desktop:openbox
./agent-toolchain/desktop/build.sh labwc      # -> sandbox/sandbox-desktop:labwc
```

## Display env reaches jobs

The worker's job environment **inherits** the worker's own environment (see the
repo README), so `DISPLAY` (openbox) / `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
(labwc) are visible to jobs — a GUI program run from a job appears on the
desktop with no extra plumbing.
